# allow for it.  But artist discretion, pretend all years are the same.

As I have both Narcolepsy, and possible Dyslexia.
Thinking, takes a lot out, but let's try.
I was born 2-2-64, as 1964/4 gies a leap year.
The comment will be longer that the maths,
But, I learned years ago, "Not just what, but why?"
Taking 1964, and 2012 this year as special cases, as neither are full years.
Include 11 leap years, the rest as notmal 365 days.
As yest unsure it there restricted words for vars..
=end
day = ((60*60)*24) # var for a day
normal_year = day * 365 # var for a year
puts =  "Number of seconds in a normal_year =" + normal_year 
years_n = normal_year * 36 # var for normal years
puts "Number of normal years  is 36, which in seconds =" + years_n  
leap_year = day * 366 # var for leap year
years_l = "Number of seconds in the leap years =" + leap_year * 11 # var for leap years
birth_y = 366-32 # var for 1964, less Jan + 1st Feb. 
# Current year is, Jan 31, Feb 29, Mar 31, April 2 (cutoff April 02 midnight)
current_y = (((31+31+29+2)*24)*60)
puts "Number of seconds I'm alive =" + (years_n +yesrs_l+birth_y+current_y)
